Hello! This is a demo site, it is written in just HTML and CSS. This site is meant to be a part of my portfolio!
This is a basic website for a fake coffee shop. I built this site to showcase some skills a web dev.

This site is built using only CSS and HTML (with help from w3.css) to showcase how simple website can be built using only these languages to provide necesarry information for porential visitors
