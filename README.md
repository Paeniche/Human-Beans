Hello! This is a demo site, it is written in just HTML and CSS. This site is meant to be a part of my portfolio!
This is a basic website for a fake coffee shop. I built this site to showcase some skills as a web dev.
In today's age of privacy some people turn off javascript to try and protect their privacy. 
This site is built using only CSS and HTML (with help from w3.css) to showcase how simple website can be built using only these languages to provide necessary information for potential visitors
